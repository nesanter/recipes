# Sunday Gravy

## Ingredients

 - 1 lamb shank
 - 1lb beef stew meat (e.g. chuck)
 - 2 italian sausages
 - pancetta
 - olive oil
 - 2-3 shallots
 - 1 head garlic
 - tomato pasta (the nice, triple-concentrated stuff)
 - beef BTB
 - 2 24oz (?) cans whole peeled tomatoes, the nice kind
 - dry marsala
 - dry basil, oregano, black pepper
 - salt

## Instructions

 1. Remove sausage casing. Cut into small pieces and roll into balls. Salt
    beef and shank. Sear meats. Deglaze with marsala.

 2. Preheat oven to 300Â°F.

 2. Mince shallot, crush garlic. Add to dutch oven with pancetta. Cook in olive
    oil until softened and lightly browned. Add some tomato paste (about 2-3
    tbsp) and about 1 tbsp BTB. Mix and deglaze with more wine. Add deglazed
    meat juices if meat was seared in separate pan or sheet. Cook gently until
    paste is somewhat colored.

 3. Add shank and other meats. Add about two cups of water. Bake for 4-5 hours,
    monitoring liquid levels.

 4. Take out shank and remove fat and bone. Remove excess liquid fat from sauce
    if desired. Shred the beef and the tomatoes with a spatula. Return lamb,
    chunked, to sauce, and stir until fat is blended. Adjust salt if needed.
