# Pork Filling for Tamales

## Ingredients

 1. 5lb pork shoulder
 2. salt
 3. olive oil
 4. 4 ancho chiles
 5. 2 guajillo chiles
 6. 1 medium sweet onion
 7. 4-6 cloves garlic
 8. 1 carton vegetable stock
 9. 2 tbsp beef Better Than Bouillon
 10. 1 tbsp tomato bouillon or 2-3 tbsp tomato paste
 11. 2 tbsp red wine vinegar, dilluted 1:1 with water
 12. oregano and cumin

## Instructions

 1. Tear apart chiles, discarding seeds and stems, and put in a bowl with the
    vegetable stock, beef bouillon, cumin, and oregano. Let them soak for
twenty to thirty minutes until softened, and then blend e.g. with an immersion
blender, or alternatively chop with kitchen scissors.

 2. Dry pork and rub with salt generously. Let sit at room temperature for
    about 15 minutes.

 3. Heat olive oil and brown each side of the pork, about 4 minutes at
    medium-high heat per side.

 4. While meat browns, dice onion and mince garlic. In the same pan as the meat
    browned, pour in a bit of the dilute vinegar and scrape up any fond with a
wooden spoon. Add onions and garlic and cook briefly.

 5. Transfer beef, chile mixture, and garlic-onion mixture to a roasting pan or
    dutch oven. Bring to a simmer, and then bake loosely covered at 275Â°F for 3
to 4 hours, until the meat tears easily with a fork. Partway through cooking,
the large roast should be cut down into roughly 1" cubes to brown more easily
and cook more evenly, after 1 hour is appropriate.
