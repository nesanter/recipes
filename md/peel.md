# Candied Peel (Succade)

## Ingredients

 - Citrus fruit
 - 1½ cup sugar plus more for coating
 - ¼ cup water (depending)

## Instructions

 1. Peel the citrus fruit like you would for eating, keeping the pith.

 2. Juice the flesh of the fruits and set aside.

 2. Cut the peel into ¼" strips of desired length. Place in pot. Cover with
    water.

 3. Boil for 10 minutes. Strain. Return to pot. Cover with fresh water. Boil
    again for 10 minutes. Strain.

 4. Combine reserved juice (adding a small amount of water for less juicy
    fruits) and sugar. Stir to disolve. Add peel.

 5. Heat until syrup reaches a temperature of 230°F (thread stage.) Remove from
    heat. Cool peel pieces on parchment paper briefly, then roll in sugar.
