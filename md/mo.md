This is half of the rou jia mo recipe. For the filling see `rou-jia-mo`.

# Mo (Buns)

## Ingredients

 - 525g (3½ cups) all purpose flour
 - 8g (2 tsp) active dry yeast
 - ¾ tsp salt
 - 1 to 1¼ cup warm water

## Instructions

 1. Combine dry ingredients in bowl of stand mixer. Whisk to mix. With the
    dough hook going on low, slowly add the water until the dough forms.

 2. Knead with dough hook for ten minutes.

 3. Form dough into ball. Transfer to greased bowl and let rise in a warm place
    for 1h.

 4. Thoroughly degas dough by kneading. Divide into twelve pieces and cover
    while working with a moist towel.

 5. With each piece, roll into a “cigar” with your hands, and then roll out
    with a pin into a long strip. Fold the strip in half across the longest
    axis and then roll it up into a pinwheel, maintaining tension on the dough
    as you roll. Smash the wheel with your hand and then roll out into a 4"
    round.

 6. Proof the rounds for 20 minutes.

 7. Heat the enameled skillet on medium for 3 to 4 minutes. Cook rounds on
    medium-low (about #2) in batches with the lid on, 2½ minutes per side.
    Adjust heat to keep the rounds from burning.
