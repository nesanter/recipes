Serve with rice.

## Ingredients

 - ¼ plus ¼ cup oil
 - 6-8 dried asian chilies
 - 3 tbsp ginger
 - 3 tbsp garlic
 - ½ tbsp douchi
 - 1 lb ground Berkshire pork
 - small pinch baking soda
 - small pinch salt
 - 1½ tbsp Shaoxing wine
 - 1 package beech mushrooms
 - 2 tbsp doubanjiang aka chili bean paste
 - 1 tbsp Szechuan peppercorns
 - 1 tbsp chicken BTB in ⅔ cup water
 - 1½ tsp cornstarch in ¼ cup water
 - 1 lb silken tofu
 - ¼ tsp sesame oil
 - pinch sugar

## Instructions

 1. Prepare the aromatics by microplaning ginger and garlic to get about 3 tbsp
    of each. Run your knife over a small mound (about 1 tbsp) of douchi a few
    times to expose the interiors. Combine the three ingredients on a small
    plate.

 2. Prepare two containers with ¼ cup oil each. Coarsely grind dried chilies
    and set aside. Separaetly, medium-fine grind the Szechuan peppercorns. Set
    aside.

 3. In a small bowl, stir together the Shaoxing wine (substitute dry sake) and
    the doubanjiang until smooth. Set aside.

 4. Cut the bottom off the Beech mushrooms, discarding it, and pull them apart
    with your hands. Set aside.

 5. Cube the tofu. Set aside.

 6. Mix the BTB into the water and set aside. Make the cornstarch slurry and
    set aside.

 7. Over medium-low heat, toast chilies in ¼ cup of oil. (About 3 minutes.)
    Reserve.

 8. Heat remaining oil and add the aromatics. Cook until fragrant, being
    careful not to burn.

 9. Add the pork, the small pinch of baking soda, and the small pinch of salt.
    Break up the meat well and cook it until fine, springy, and starting to
    brown.

 10. Add the rice wine mixture, mushrooms, szechuan peppercorns, and
     chicken broth. Simmer briefly. Combine cornstarch mixture, stirring if it
     has settled. Add to sauce, stirring gently, until it thickens.

 11. Add reserved chilies (optionally) and oil. Add tofu, cubed. Toss gently
     and simmer gently for 5 minutes.

 12. Finish with sesame oil and sugar, folding gently. Garnish with additional
     ground szechuan peppercorn if desired.
