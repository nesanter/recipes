# Zabaglione

## Ingredients

 - 5 tbsp sugar
 - 4 egg yolks
 - 5 tbsp Marsala

## Instructions

 1. Bring a pot of water to a gentle simmer.

 2. Measure out Marsala in small bowl near stove. Measure out sugar in metal
    bowl. Add egg yolks. Whisk until sugar is dissolved.

 3. Cook yolk mixture above pot, careful so that the bowl does not touch the
    water for 3 minutes, whisking constantly. Add Marsala and keep whisking
    until done, about another 2-3 minutes. Mixture should be firm but not set,
    airy, and live a ribbon when dropped.
