# Rou Jia Mo (“Chinese Hamburgers”)

## Ingredients

 - 2 lb pork belly
 - 3 cups water
 - ¼ cup Shaoxing wine
 - 12g rock sugar
 - 2 tbsp light soy sauce
 - 1 tbsp dark soy sauce
 - 4 scallions, halved lengthwise
 - 3 slices ginger
 - 2 star anise
 - 1 cinnamon stick
 - 1 black cardamom pod
 - 2 pieces galangal
 - 1 tsp Sichuan peppercorns
 - 3 bay leaves
 - salt (to taste)
 - 1 bunch (about 1 cup) chopped cilantro, destemmed

## Instructions

 1. Preheat oven to 325°F.

 2. Cut pork belly into large (4"-5") pieces. Place in a pot with enough water
    to cover and bring to a boil. Once it has boiled, shut off the heat, remove
    and rinse the pork, and discard the water.

 3. Place the pork belly in a clean pot with remaining ingredients (except
    cilantro.) Bring to a simmer and transfer to the oven, loosely covered,
    for 2 hours.

 4. At this point, start the bun recipe.

 5. Remove from oven. Remove from pork and clean and chop. Discard solids in
    the sauce and return pork to it. Cook sauce down further if desired,
    uncovered at a low simmer.

 6. Add cilantro and stir to mix.

 7. Slice buns and serve with pork and sauce as a filling.
