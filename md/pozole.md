 2. De-glaze with sherry vinegar. Add water.

 6. Cook at a heavy simmer for 60 minutes. Strain, retaining the broth.
 7. While cooking, combine dried ancho and guajillo peppers with 2 cups of warm water. Let rehydrate for thirty minutes, then blend. Add to the broth. Check salt level and adjust if needed.
 8. Add hominy, diced potatoes, diced red onion, and sliced leeks.

 10. While simmering, spatchcock and salt a chicken and bake it for 50 minutes at 425°F.
 11. Remove the meat from the bones and skin and add to the soup.

## Spice Level

To increase the spice level, add more serrano peppers to the first broth, more guajillo peppers to the blend, let the fresh peppers sit for a few days so their color turns, or (most traditionally) add arbol chilies.

## Hominy

I use a 25 oz can of Juanita's branch hominy. (Kroger sells them.)
