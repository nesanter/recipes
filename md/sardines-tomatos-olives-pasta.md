# Unnamed Pasta Dish

## Ingredients

 - pasta al nero, e.g. fettucine
 - about ½ cup sun dried tomatoes in oil, drained
 - about ¼ cup oil cured olives, pitted
 - 2 container sardines in oil, lightly smoked with lemon, drained
 - 1 container anchovy filets in oil, drained
 - 2-3 clove garlic
 - top shelf olive oil
 - 1 tbsp mild red pepper flakes
 - (optional) splash dry marsala wine
 - ¼ to ½ cup reserved pasta water

## Instructions

 1. Boil lightly salted water for pasta. Cook pasta according to instructions
    on package, reserving ¼ to ½ cup of starchy pasta water. Toss in olive oil
    and set aside.

 2. Pit olives and break into rough thirds and halves. Drain oil from
    anchovies, sardines, and tomatoes.

 2. In a skillet, heat olive oil over medium-low heat. Mash garlic cloves with
    flat of knife and peel. Sautee them in the oil with the drained sun dried
    tomatoes and the red pepper flakes, stirring occasionally.

 3. When fragment and starting to brown, add anchovies and olives. Cook briefly
    then add the pasta water. Work it with a spatula to break down the
    anchovies as it thickens.

 4. Add the olives, sardines, and optional splash of marsala. Let it cook down,
    stirring gently to avoid breaking the sardines, for two to three minutes.

 5. When reduced and glossy (judge from bubble size), add the pasta to the
    skillet and gently fold to coat. Serve when sauce sticks to the pasta and
    the skillet bottom is dry.
